## 285. Inorder Successor in BST

Follow-up: [510. Inorder Successor in BST II](https://github.com/junj0619/CodeLab/blob/master/src/CS1802/Tree/510.%20Inorder%20Successor%20in%20BST%20II.md)
### Brute Force Iteration   
Using iterative way to do in-order traversel. Once meet the target node then next pop node is the successor.

Time complexity: O(h)   
Space complexity: O(h)

```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        boolean found = false;
        
        while (root != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {
            while (root != null) {
                stack.push(root);
                root = root.left;
            }
            
            TreeNode node = stack.pop();
            if (found) return node;
            
            if (node == p) found = true;
            
            root = node.right;            
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

### Recursion Solution
let's take the successor for example, basically we always want to find p's closest node (in inorder traversal) and the node's value is larger than p's value, right? That node can either be p's parent or the smallest node in p' right branch.

When the code runs into the else block, that means the current root is either p's parent or a node in p's right branch.

If it's p's parent node, there are two scenarios: 

1. p doesn't have right child, in this case, the recursion will eventually return null, so p's parent is the successor.  
2. p has right child, then the recursion will return the smallest node in the right sub tree, and that will be the answer.

If it's p's right child, there are two scenarios: 
1. the right child has left sub tree, eventually the smallest node from the left sub tree will be the answer.  
2. the right child has no left sub tree, the recursion will return null, then the right child (root) is our answer.

### Successor
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode inorderSuccessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        
        if (root.val <= p.val) {
            return inorderSuccessor(root.right, p);
        } else {
            TreeNode left = inorderSuccessor(root.left, p);
            return left == null ? root : left;
        }
    }
}
```

### Predecessor
```java
public TreeNode predecessor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p) {
  if (root == null)
    return null;

  if (root.val >= p.val) {
    return predecessor(root.left, p);
  } else {
    TreeNode right = predecessor(root.right, p);
    return (right != null) ? right : root;
  }
}
```

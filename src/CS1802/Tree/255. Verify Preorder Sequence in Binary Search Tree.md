##  255. Verify Preorder Sequence in Binary Search Tree


Consider the following binary search tree: 
<pre>
     5
    / \
   2   6
  / \
 1   3
</pre> 


Example 1:
<pre>
Input: [5,2,6,1,3]
Output: false
</pre>

Example 2:
<pre>
Input: [5,2,1,3,6]
Output: true
</pre>


Using stack to traverse the tree. If current element is smaller than peek in stack means we are going to left subtree. So we push element to the stack.
If current element is greater than current element means we are going to travel right subtree so that we need to popup any element that is smaller than it. And to use BST feature we know any element in right subtree must greater than its parent. So if we find an element that is smaller than its parent then return false.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean verifyPreorder(int[] preorder) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int low = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int pre : preorder) {
            if (pre < low) {
                return false;
            }
            
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() < pre) {
                low = stack.pop();
            }
            
            stack.push(pre);
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

```

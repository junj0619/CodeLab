## 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

       
**Note:**

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.


### Idea:
This problem can be divide to 2 sub problems
1. Find Nodes P and Q
2. Check current Node is LCA of P and Q

For #1 we could travers the root left/right tree to see if node is the P/Q.
For #2 for vaild LCA either it is first seen node that contains P and Q from bottom to top.
       or LCA is either P/Q node.
       
Since giving node says both p and q will exist in the binary tree. 
so in case of LCA is either P/Q we just return the first node we seen

### Time Complexity : O(n)
Worest case: Need to visited all the treenodes.

### Space Complexity : O(h) 
Recursion Stack will be height of tree


```java

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || p == root || q == root) return root;
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        
        if (left == null || right == null) 
            return left == null ? right : left;
        else
            return root;
    }
}

```

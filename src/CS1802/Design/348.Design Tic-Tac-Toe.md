## 348.Design Tic-Tac-Toe ##

### Idea: ###
To win the Tic-Tac-Toe game, at least one player need to have N mark(X)/(O) in any of following directions.

1. Horizontal 
2. Vertical
3. Diagonal Left
4. Diagonal Right

And we know in N*N matrix we could have N rows/columns. And only two Diagonals left and right.
So we need to store each row and col status to check each move any of four directions has enough mark to win for that player.
So by this think we could use 2 arrays(rows/cols) and 2 int variables(left/right diagnoal) to store all these four directions status.

And to distinguish which player win the game we can reference **Min-Max Strategy**. 
To let player 1 add one and let player 2 subtract one. 
Then to win a game we just need to check four directions abs(value) equal to given N.

### Time Complexity : O(1) ###
### Space Complexity: O(N) ###

```java

class TicTacToe {
    private int[] rowCount;
    private int[] colCount;
    private int leftDiagCount;
    private int rightDiagCount;
    private int n;
   
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rowCount = new int[n];
        colCount = new int[n];
        this.n = n;
       
    }
    
    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int val = 0;
        val = (player == 1) ? 1 : -1 ;
        
        rowCount[row] += val;
        colCount[col] += val;
        if (row == col) leftDiagCount += val;
        if ((n - row - 1) == col) rightDiagCount += val;
        
        if (Math.abs(rowCount[row]) == n || Math.abs(colCount[col]) == n 
            || Math.abs(leftDiagCount) == n || Math.abs(rightDiagCount) == n) {
            return (val == 1) ? 1 : 2;
        } else {
            return 0;
        } 
            
    }

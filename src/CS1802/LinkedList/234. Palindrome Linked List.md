## 234. Palindrome Linked List

**Idea:**   
Find mid point of linked list then do the reverse second half. Then compare both first and second half value.

**Mistake was made:**  
When do the comparison should use second half linked list not null as ternimation logic.
Because if linkedlist is odd length like 1->2->1 it will convert first half to 1->2 and second half to 1.
So learn it from mistake avoid this next time.


```java

/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return true;
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);       
        ListNode first = null, second = null, slow = dummy, fast = dummy;
        dummy.next = head; 
      
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {     //find pre-mid node
            fast = fast.next.next;
            slow = slow.next;            
        }
        
        second = slow.next;
        slow.next = null;
        
        ListNode cur = second, pre = null, next = null;
        while (cur != null) {                          //reverse second half of linkedlist
            next = cur.next;
            cur.next = pre;
            pre = cur;
            cur = next;
        }
        
        first = dummy.next;
        second = pre;
        
        while (second != null) {                     //compare both first and second half
            if (first.val != second.val)
                return false;
            first = first.next;
            second = second.next;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

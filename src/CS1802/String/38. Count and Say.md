## Count and Say ##

Idea and Keypoint: 

It takes time to understand the questions. 

Once figure it out the question become clean.

1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221

The input n is stand for nth CountAndSay number. Let's say n = 4
So it is actually Say 'one 2 one 1' for last count which #3.

So the problem become following sub problems.
1. To get Nth say we need to know N-1 th Say
2. Count the number and convert to string 

Since we know we start from "1" so we can set inital status as "1" and then start from there do the iteration.

And for #2 we can use two pointer to compare same character is appearing and update the count same time.

### Time Complexity: O(N^2) ###

### Space Complexity: O(1) ###

```java

class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
        String res = "1";
             
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {    
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            int count = 1;
            int pre = 0;
            for (int cur = 1; cur < res.length(); cur++) {
                if (res.charAt(pre) == res.charAt(cur)) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    sb.append(count + "" + res.charAt(pre));
                    count = 1;
                    pre = cur;
                }                
            }    
            sb.append(count + "" + res.charAt(pre));
            res = sb.toString();         
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}

```

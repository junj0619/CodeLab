## 65. Valid Number

  We start with trimming.

1. If we see [0-9] we reset the number flags.
2. We can only see . if we didn't see e or ..
3. We can only see e if we didn't see e but we did see a number. We reset numberAfterE flag.
4. We can only see + and - in the beginning and after an e
5. Any other character break the validation.
6. At the and it is only valid if there was at least 1 number and if we did see an e then a number after it as well.


```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isNumber(String s) {
//       We start with trimming.

//       1.If we see [0-9] we reset the number flags.
//       2.We can only see . if we didn't see e or ..

<h2>200. Number of Islands</h2>
<h3>Question</h3>

Given a 2d grid map of **'1'**s  (land) and **'0'**s (water), count the number of islands. 
An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. 
You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>  
11110
11010
11000
00000

<b>Output: 1</b> 
</pre>
**Example 2:**
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>  
11000
11000
00100
00011

<b>Output: 3</b>
</pre>

<h2>Thinking</h2>
Primitive idea is find a '1' in giving grid and try to explore more '1's in its neighbors. And remember the visited node in the grid to avoid visit again.
Once there no more '1' in the neighbors then stop explore for current node. Continue looking for next avaiable '1' and do the above process again.  
Store visited nodes need extral spaces if we can assume modify input grid is allowed. Then we can modify all visited node to '0' to implement visited logic.

<h3>Complexity Analysis</h3>

**Time Complexity:** O(mn) since each position on the grid will be visited for at most once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) we modify input to avoid extra space consumption.

```java

class Solution {
    private int rows;
    private int cols;
    private int [][] direction;
    
    public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0 || grid[0] == null) return 0;
        
        int islands = 0;
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        direction = new int[][] { {-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1} };
        
        for (int row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
            for (int col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
                if (grid[row][col] == '1') {
                    islands++;
                    dfs(row, col, grid);
                }
            }
        }                
        return islands;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int row, int col, char[][] grid) {
        
        grid[row][col] = '0';
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int x = direction[i][0] + row;
            int y = direction[i][1] + col;
            if (x < 0 || x >= rows || y < 0 || y >= cols || grid[x][y] == '0') {
                continue;
            }
            dfs(x, y, grid);

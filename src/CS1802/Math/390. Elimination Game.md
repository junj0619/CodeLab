## 390. Elimination Game

Example:
<pre>
Input:
n = 9,
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
2 4 6 8
2 6
6

Output:
6
</pre>


### Idea:
We just need to decide how do we update the 'head'.   
The final state is that there is only one number left, that should be the head.    

If this turn is from left to right, so the current head will be anyway deleted, so we must update the head to head + step. 
  
If the current turn is from right to left and the current number of numbers is odd, the head also must be updated, for example, the current remaining numbers are [2, 4, 6, 8], we remove the numbers 8, 4, so when we get the next turn (from left to right), the head will be still 2, which means we don't need to update the head. 

But if the current remaining numbers are [2, 4, 6], and we remove the numbers from right to left, so we deleted the 6, 2, and when we hit the next turn(from left to right), the head will be 4, which means we need to update the head to 4 here.

```java
class Solution {
    public int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head = 1, step = 1;
        boolean fromLeft = true;
        
        while (n > 1) {
            if (fromLeft || n % 2 == 1) {
                head += step;                
            }
            step *= 2;
            n /= 2;
            fromLeft = !fromLeft;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## 1185. Day of the Week

A **leap** year is exactly divisible by 4 except for century years (years ending with 00). The century year is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400.

This solution uses the current date (literally the day you sit down to solve the problem) to find the correct offset to a list of strings representings the days of the week, i.e. [ "Sunday", "Monday", ... ].

In general, you can start the list of days with a known date. For example, if today when writing the solution is Day = 14, Month = 9, and Year = 2019 and you know the day name is "Saturday" then +1 day must be "Sunday" and likewise -1 day must be "Friday".

So start your list of day names with the known date of "today", e.g. "Saturday". Then, find the number of days since the start of the valid range for both your known date and the input date. Note, the code considers 1, 1, 1971 to be 1 day after the start and so on.

The difference will be the +1, -1, .. etc. offset that you are looking for, just use this difference mod 7 to correctly index the list of days.

```java
class Solution {
    String[] days = {"Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday","Sunday", "Monday","Tuesday", "Wednesday"};
        int[] months = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};

    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {                
        
        int currentCount = getDayCount(27, 2, 2020);
        int inputCount = getDayCount(day, month, year);
        
        return days[((inputCount - currentCount) % 7 + 7) % 7];
    }
    
    private int getDayCount(int day, int month, int year) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 1971; i < year; i++) {
            sum += 365;
            if (isLeapYear(i)) sum++;
        }
        
        for (int j = 1; j < month; j++) {
            sum += months[j - 1];
            if (j == 2 && isLeapYear(year)) {
                sum ++;
            }
        }
        
        sum += day;
        return sum;
    }
    
    private boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
       	return (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0) || year % 400 == 0;
    }
}
```

## 168. Excel Sheet Column Title

### Idea: ###

Use giving number mod 26 to get the last column title. Then do number divide 26 to go next iteration do the same.  

**Example:** 

    29 => AC  
    29 % 26 = 3 => C  
    29 / 26 = 1   
    
    1 % 26 = 1 => A  (append A to the front C)
    1 / 26 = 0 DONE return AC

### How we deal with n equals 26 (Z)?  

1. If we do 26 % 26 it becomes 0 then there is no matching title for 0.
2. And 26 / 26 = 1 then next iteration becomes 1 % 26 = 1 (A) which is wrong.

We can see actually 0 is stand for 'A' not 1 so that we can use **'A' + X = letter**('A' + 0 = 'A') to resolve **#1**.  
And for **#2** we should stop next iteration if n is **[1, 26]** so since we analyze 0 should be mapped 'A' and given n is 1 base 
we just need to 0 base. So we just do **n--** at begining. So 26 become 25 and it wouldn't create next iteration.


```java

class Solution {
    public String convertToTitle(int n) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

        while (n > 0) {
            n--; //26 => 'Z' not 'BA' 0 base26 and 'A' count as 1
            sb.insert(0, (char)(n % 26 + 'A'));
            n = n / 26;
        }        
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}

```

## 277. Find the Celebrity

### Idea:
To be a valid celebrity must satisfy following two conditions 

1) Celebrity doesnâ€™t know anyone 

2) Everyone must know celebrity. 

So next step just will be just find a way to pick possible celebrity then do the validation against 1) and 2) rules. 

Brute force way to find possible celebrity will be try each person then ask question do you know anyone in the party? 

Then it will lead to (n^2) time complexity. We could use reverse engineering thinking to assume any person know somebody that means the person is not celebrity. 

Then we can come up the approach with O(n) time complexity. 

Following graph explains the scenario of validated and invalidated celebrity.


```java

/* The knows API is defined in the parent class Relation.
      boolean knows(int a, int b); */

public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int potentialCelebrity = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (knows(potentialCelebrity, i)) {
                potentialCelebrity = i;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i == potentialCelebrity) continue;
            
            if (!knows(i, potentialCelebrity) || knows(potentialCelebrity, i)) return -1;
        }
        
        return potentialCelebrity;
    }
}
```

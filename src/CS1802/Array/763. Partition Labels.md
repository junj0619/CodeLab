## 763. Partition Labels

A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]

Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

            //if index is reached to end then means we have found the partition.
            if (j == end) {

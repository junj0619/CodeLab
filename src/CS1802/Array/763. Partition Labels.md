## 763. Partition Labels

A string S of lowercase letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

<pre>
Example 1:
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]

Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".  
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.  
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.

### Idea: ###
The requirement is asked for to "partition as many parts as possible that each letter appears in at most one part".  
For given example this means   [ababcbaca] only a,b,c in this partition so length become 9  
                             [defegde] only d,e,f,g in this partition so length become 7     
                             [hijhklij] only h,i,j,k in this partition so length become 8    
  
In another word we have to find out what is the last index for current character. And see if this last index can be the end position for the partiton.  
For example [ababcbaca] LastIndex of a = 8, b = 5, c = 7 so we can say a = 8 is the end of current parition to calculate the length we just need to do end-start+1 to get the length.

Time Complexity: O(n)
```java
class Solution {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String S) {        
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int[] lastIndex = new int[26];
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        
        //Calculate lastIndex for each character
        for (int i = 0; i < S.length(); i++) {
            lastIndex[S.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;                                    
        }
            
        for (int j = 0; j < S.length(); j++) {
            //find current end position
            end = Math.max(end, lastIndex[S.charAt(j) - 'a']);
            
            //if index is reached to end then means we have found the partition.
            if (j == end) {
                list.add(end - start + 1);
                start = end + 1;
            }            
        }
        
        return list;        
    }

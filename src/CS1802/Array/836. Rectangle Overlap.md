## 836. Rectangle Overlap

### My solution can be optimized with better clean code .  
### Idea
Base on array overlapping logic, break each rectange to [x1, x2] and [y1, y2].
Then compare if contains overlap in x and y between two rectangles

```java

class Solution {
    public boolean isRectangleOverlap(int[] rec1, int[] rec2) {
        
        int[] rec1X = {rec1[0], rec1[2]};
        int[] rec1Y = {rec1[1], rec1[3]};
        int[] rec2X = {rec2[0], rec2[2]};
        int[] rec2Y = {rec2[1], rec2[3]};
        
        if (isOverlap(rec1X, rec2X) && isOverlap(rec1Y, rec2Y))
            return true;      
        else
            return false;
    }
    
    private boolean isOverlap(int[] r1, int[] r2) {
        if (
            ((r1[1] > r2[0]) && (r1[0] < r2[1])) 
            || ((r2[1] > r1[0]) && (r2[0] < r1[1]))
           )
            return true;
        else 
            return false;
    }
}

```
